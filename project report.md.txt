A currency converter allows users to calculate the value of one currency in terms of
another. In this article, we’ll build two Python-based currency converters:
1. Using the Fixer API for live exchange rates (CLI version)
2. Using Tkinter + forex_python for a GUI-based converter
This project is a command-line utility built in Python that allows users to perform
real-time currency conversions by fetching the latest exchange rates from a public
Web API.
get_exchange_rate(base_currency, target_currency)
​API Integration: Uses the requests.get() method to make an API call to the public
Exchangerate-API.
​Dynamic URL: The base currency code is integrated directly into the API URL to
fetch rates relative to the user&#39;s specified base, e.g., https://api.exchangerate-
api.com/v4/latest/USD.
​Validation: It rigorously checks the HTTP status code and verifies the presence of
the rates key in the JSON response before attempting to extract the final rate.
​2. convert_currency()
​Input Validation: A try...except ValueError block is used to ensure the user enters a
valid numerical amount for conversion, preventing application crashes from non-
numeric input.
​Workflow:
​Collects user input for currency codes and amount.
​Calls get_exchange_rate() to fetch the multiplier.
​If a rate is successfully returned, it performs the calculation and prints the result,
rounded to two decimal places.
​If the rate fetch fails, it provides a clear message to the user.

​ Demonstrated Skills
​This project successfully showcases the following core programming and
development skills:
​External API Integration: Proficiency in consuming RESTful APIs for real-world
data.
​Network Programming: Effective use of the requests library for HTTP
communication.
​Data Serialization/Deserialization: Handling and parsing JSON data.
​Modular Programming: Breaking down the problem into logical, reusable
functions.
​Input Handling &amp; Validation: Creating a user-friendly command-line interface with
robust error checking.
